CloudFormation does not have the permission to generate the required S3 policy Due to that I receive the following error Could it be related to the following What is the issue Amazon S3 Buckets have a property called `ObjectOwnersh ip` It has 3 possible settings `BucketOwnerEnforced` access to all objects in the bucket is controlled via the buckets Bucket Policy Access Control Lists ACLs are disallowed both on a perobject as well as bucketwide level `ObjectWriter` ACLs are allowed object writers decide the ACL for each object `BucketOwnerPreferred` ACLs are allowed object writers can decide each objects ACL but the default is to honor the Bucket Policy Before April 2023 the default was to create new buckets with `ObjectOwnership ObjectWriter` which means it is possible to configure ACLs on the buckets and on objects by default In April 2023 S3 has changed the default to `ObjectOwnership BucketOwnerEnforced` which means it is no longer possible to configure ACLs on the buckets and on objects by default Since this change affects only the defaults for new buckets this change has no effect on existing S3 Buckets Announcement [Amazon S3 will automatically enable S3 Block Public Access and disable access control lists for all new buckets starting in April 2023] httpsaws amazon comaboutawswhatsnew202212amazons3automaticallyenableblockpublicaccessdisableaccesscontrollistsbucketsapril2023 What is the impact Depending on your CDK version and feature flags CDK may try to configure buckets with an ACL relying on the default `ObjectOwnership ObjectWriter` for this to be allowed After April 2023 buckets with ACLs will fail to deploy with the following error ```text Bucket cannot have ACLs set with ObjectOwnerships BucketOwnerEnforced setting ``` What code is affected by this change If you meet any of the following criteria then you are not affected and can stop reading You are using `awscdklib 2 60 0` the feature flag `awscdkawss3serverAccessLogsUseBucketPolicy true` is set and you are not using CloudFront logging OR You are using `awscdklib 2 77 0` Otherwise keep on reading to find out what patterns may lead a bucket to fail creation You could be affected if you use `awscdklib aws_s3 Bucket` directly or if you use a 3rd party construct library that creates S3 Buckets There are a couple of cases how a Bucket created by CDK may end up with an ACL configured on it We will go over them here Explicit bucket ACL If you explicitly set the ACL to one of `PUBLIC_READ` `AWS_EXEC_READ` `PUBLIC_READ_WRITE` `AUTHENTICATED_READ` or `LOG_DELIVERY_WRITE` Example ```ts new s3 Bucket this Bucket accessControl s3 BucketAccessControl PUBLIC_READ ``` Using a serverAccessLogsBucket If you set one bucket as the `serverAccessLogsBucket` of another CDK automatically configures it with permissions for writing logs Example ```ts const serverAccessLogsBucket new s3 Bucket this AccessLogsBucket const sourceBucket new s3 Bucket this Bucket serverAccessLogsBucket ``` If you are on a version ` 2 60 0` and have the feature flag `awscdkawss3serverAccessLogsUseBucketPolicy true` configured CDK will use a Bucket Policy for log writing permissions and you are not affected Otherwise it will use ACLs and you are affected Using an S3 Bucket for CloudFront logs When you create a CloudFront Distribution with `enableLogging true` the CDK will automatically create a logging bucket for you that uses ACLs ```ts new cloudfront Distribution this Distribution enableLogging true ``` If you are providing your own `logBucket` you will fall into case 1 where you are explicitly configuring the bucket to use the log delivery ACL How do I resolve this If you upgrade `awscdklib` to `2 77 0` we will automatically set `ObjectOwnership` for you if you configure an ACL Only if you are not able to upgrade `awscdklib` quickly enough see the instructions below for workarounds Explicit ACL configuration If you are explicitly setting the Bucket ACL then you need to now also explicitly set the ObjectOwnership to `OBJECT_WRITER` ```ts new s3 Bucket this Bucket accessControl s3 BucketAccessControl PUBLIC_READ objectOwnership s3 ObjectOwnership OBJECT_WRITER ``` Using a serverAccessLogsBucket If configuring server access logs and you are on `awscdklib` `2 60 0 2 77 0` then set the `awscdkawss3serverAccessLogsUseBucketPolicy` feature flag to true This can be done either globally in the `cdk json` file or on a per construct basis by using `setContext` ```ts class MyConstruct extends Construct constructor scope Construct id string super scope id this node setContext awscdkawss3serverAccessLogsUseBucketPolicy true const serverAccessLogsBucket new s3 Bucket this AccessLogsBucket const sourceBucket new s3 Bucket this Bucket serverAccessLogsBucket ``` If using CDK v1 or `awscdklib` `2 60 0` then you have to configure ObjectOwnership directly ```ts const serverAccessLogsBucket new s3 Bucket this AccessLogsBucket objectOwnership s3 ObjectOwnership OBJECT_WRITER const sourceBucket new s3 Bucket this Bucket serverAccessLogsBucket ``` Using an S3 Bucket for CloudFront logs [CloudFront logging still requires ACLs] httpsdocs aws amazon comAmazonCloudFrontlatestDeveloperGuideAccessLogs htmlaccesslogschoosings3bucket If you are providing your own logging bucket to CloudFront then you need to make sure to set the `ObjectOwnership` property ```ts new cloudfront Distribution this Distribution logBucket new s3 Bucket this Bucket objectOwnership s3 ObjectOwnership OBJECT_WRITER ``` If you are using `enableLogging true` to have a bucket automatically created you should upgrade to `2 77 0` to set the `ObjectOwnership` option correctly or use escape hatches to force the option to `ObjectOwnership` serverless yml"

tweaking things researching tweaking again consulting documentation etc etc I cannot for the life of me figure out what Ive got wrong and why this isnt working My stack is the photos backend for a mobile app I am developing Initially I had it set up to accept requests through an AWS HTTP 2 0 API Gateway and forward them to a one of three Lambda functions one to return the result of a createPresignedPost request one for deleting a single object and one for deleting multiple objects I also implemented a custom authorizer as a Lambda function which receives a JSON web token generated when my users authenticate and passes it in each of the above three requests as an Authorization header which is decoded using a secret stored in AWS secrets in order to authenticate the above CRUDstyle requests Users upload files using the createPresignedPost API call which returns a URL and some headers which are used to construct a POST request to that url with the image file attached and volia the image is in my AWS bucket All of this was working wonderfully I then moved on to upgrade the system first by adding an s3 event trigger on the aforementioned bucket for the s3ObjectCreated action which runs a Lambda function that compresses uploaded images as JPGs Initially I followed the guidance to set up the event entirely under the the lambda function in my serverless yml and the first problem I ran into was I was getting the bucket already exists error because my event trigger was creating the bucket I had already specified in my resources section First I marked it with existing true but this did nothing and my assumption is this only works for buckets that exist already in the stack on AWS not potentially in the serverless deployment I had to remove the duplicate bucket from my resources section and because I need additional configuration options such as LifecycleConfiguration CorsConfiguration and PublicAccessBlockConfiguration I followed guidance in the docs to move the s3 bucket and event trigger to the provider section of serverless yml I was still having problems and realized I had to define my s3 event trigger under the providers s3 definition as part of notificationConfiguration LambdaConfigurations This solved that error Now I am stuck on the error in the title something seems to be wrong with my iAmRoleStatements section but I cant figure out what it is The compression Lambda function gets files from the original bucket sourceBucket and after compressing them places them into targetBucket I created a resource for the targetBucket but not the sourceBucket because that is created in the definition under provider I also have BucketPolicy resources for both buckets and Ive given them minimum needed iAmRoleStatements permissions under provider I also added a third bucket and corresponding BucketPolicy and iAMRoleStatement for a future publicBucket Basically users select or take photos in my app and they are immediately added to sourceBucket then compressed and copied to targetBucket Only after a user either finishes creating a profile or presses Save Changes on their edit profile page will those photos in targetBucket be moved to publicBucket using a batch action to limit API calls where they can be consumed by the public in the app as profile photos The photos in sourceBucket and targetBucket act as temporary files and have an ExpirationInDays LifecycleConfiguration rule that periodically cleans out any images left behind after users either successfully createedit their profiles or abandon the process Below is my serverless yml in full The full error I am getting is If anyone can identify why I am receiving this error I would really really appreciate the help I have been banging my head against the wall for way too long on this with no progress and I am up against the wall with a deadline My backup plan is to revert to what I had working before and try to install the compression event trigger manually on the AWS web console but I would really prefer the whole thing be written out using serverlessIaC Hopefully its something stupid that my tired eyes just cant see anymore Thanks Avana For some reason this forums spam bot hid my reply to this post so Im adding it here I solved the malformed policy issue For reference I had to use awsaccountId in string replacement contexts but AWSAccountId in Ref contexts I was switching between either format for all in my attempts Anyway now Im getting a new error that has me stumped Somehow cloud formation is trying to create my sourceBucket twice even though I specifically removed it from the resources section because its defined with the event trigger under provider I also tried removing the associated BucketPolicy to no avail I followed the instructions here to a tee for configuring an event trigger to work with a custom bucket configuration Whats weird is in my attempts to troubleshoot this earlier I removed all of the event trigger stuff and just tried to have the original code that was working plus create another two buckets as resources and I was getting this same error As soon as I removed the other two buckets it worked again Yet there was no naming confusion or mixed up variables So I am thinking either there is something going on with the fact that Im trying to crate multiple buckets or the guidance for referencing custom buckets in the serverless docs is wrong "

00:55:37+02","2024-04-30 17:46:07.918556+03","serverless framework","We use the serverless framework and a week or two ago we received the message below from AWS I havent seen any discussion about this anywhere which is puzzling because it seems like its a policy change that would affect more than a few people The instructions are fairly clear but since this stuff is managed through the serverless framework Id assume theres either some update that must be made to the framework or something we need to change on our end in config Has anyone else received this message or otherwise know what action is best here Message from AWS Hello You are receiving this email because AWS Lambda is making a change to the IAM policy evaluation when accessing Lambda function APIs and we identified that your account will be impacted by this change We would like to offer some background about usage of Lambda function APIs A Lambda function may include versions [1] and aliases [2] which are subresources of a function You can operate on versions and aliases using the Lambda function APIs in one of two ways 1 You can either append the version number or alias name as a suffix to the function ARN We will refer to this as a qualified Amazon Resource Name ARN or 2 You can specify only the function ARN we refer to this as an unqualified ARN and add a separate qualifier parameter in the API command For example a function helloworld with version 42 can be passed into API request using the function ARN as arnawslambdaawsregionacctidfunctionhelloworld42 or arnawslambdaawsregionacctidfunctionhelloworld Qualifier42 These call types are equivalent Currently you can restrict the scope of a users permissions to the Lambda function APIs by using an unqualified ARN in the Resource element of your IAM or VPC endpoint policy Previously when used in this way Lambda interpreted such permissions in one of two ways depending on the API usage Either by granting permission to requests to the function only or granting permissions to requests to the function and all of its subresources For example when using IAM or VPC endpoint policy with resource element as unqualified ARN arnawslambdaawsregionacctidfunctionhelloworld API Request s with qualified ARN as arnawslambdaawsregionacctidfunctionhelloworld42 is denied and the request using arnawslambdaawsregionacctidfunctionhelloworld Qualifier42 is allowed We received customer feedback that this dual interpretation was not always intuitive To address this feedback and increase the consistency of the Lambda function APIs authorization starting January 24 2022 Lambda requires IAM or VPC endpoint policies to specify the fully qualified ARN in the Resource element when authorizing API calls that use an unqualified ARN with a qualifier parameter We identified that your AWS account calls AWS Lambda APIs using the unqualified ARN with a qualifier parameter while the associated permissions for the user who makes these API calls use the unqualified ARN in the policys Resource element To continue making these API calls successfully you need to append the version number alias name to the unqualified function ARN in your policys Resource element To allow access to all the subresources of a function append and to the unqualified function ARN and to allow access to both function unqualified ARN and all subresources of a function append to the unqualified function ARN Additionally you need to ensure the updated policies are used by the IAM usersroles that make the Lambda API calls Please find the following instructions on how to make this change This change will begin on April 30 2022 to give you ample time to update your IAM policies or permissions attached to the users and roles that call Lambda APIs before that We have also provided a list of your affected resources in the USEAST1 Region at the end of this message to make it easier to locate and update them If you do not take this action by April 30 2022 Lambda API calls will fail with permission errors Steps to update your IAM policies The list of affected function ARN region qualifier value used in the qualifier parameter Lambda API name are provided to you in format API operation function excluding qualifier qualifier Starting at the IAM Console go to Policies Look for policies that match Resource field as function ARN For example If the function ARN is arnawslambdaawsregionacctidfunctionmyfunction find policies where Resource field contains functionmyfunction For the matching policies Click on the Edit Policy button and select JSON Change the Resource field from Resource [arnawslambdaawsregionacctidfunctionmyfunction ] to Resource [arnawslambdaawsregionacctidfunctionmyfunctionstage] to authorize access to a function alias in this example stage is the name of the alias Alternatively change the Resource field to Resource [arnawslambdaawsregionacctidfunctionmyfunction1] to authorize access to a specific function version in this example 1 is the version number To allow access to all subresources of a function append and to function name by changing the Resource field to Resource [arnawslambdaawsregionacctidfunctionmyfunction ] To allow access to function unqualified ARN and its subresources append to function name by

begin this issue I had Serverless running and was using it with this package httpsgithub comadieuadieuserverlesschrometreemasterexamplesserverlessframeworkaws When I sudo npm run deploy I get the ServerlessError ServerlessError User arnawsstsXXXassumedroleEC2CodeDeployi268b1acf is not authorized to perform cloudformationDescribeStackResources on resource arnawscloudformationuseast1YYYstackawsdev Im not sure why it is trying to connect to a Role and not an IAM So I check the Role and it is in an entirely different AWS account than the account Ive configured Lets call this Account B When it comes to configuration Ive installed AWS CLI and entered in the key id and region in my Account A in AWS Not touching Account B whatsoever When I run aws s3 ls I see the correct s3 buckets of the account with the keyidregioin so I know CLI is working with the correct account Sounds good I check the awscreditionals file and just has one profile [default] which seems normal No other profiles are in here I copied this over to the awsconfig file so now both files are same Works great I then go into my SSH where Ive installed serverless and run npm run deploy and it gives me the same message above I think maybe somehow it is not using the correct account for whatever reason So I manually set the access key and secret with the following commands serverless config credentials provider aws key XXX secret YYY It tells me there already is a profile in the aws creds file so I then add o to the end to overwrite I run sudo npm run deploy and still same error I then run this command to manually set a profile in the creds for serverless with the profile name matching the IAM user name serverless config credentials provider aws key XXX secret YYY profile serverlessagent Where serverlessagent is the name of my IAM user Ive been trying to use to deploy I run this it tells me there already is an existing profile in the aws creds file so I run it with o and it tells me the aws file is now updated In bash I go to Vim the file and I only see the single [default] settings as if nothing has changed I run sudo npm run deploy and it gives me the same Error I then go and manually set the access and secret I run sudo npm run deploy and it gives me the same Error I even removed AWS CLI and the directory that holds the creditionals and config files and when I manually set my account creds via serverless config it tells me there already is a profile set up in my aws file prompting me to use the overwrite command how is this possible when the file is literally not on my computer So I then think that serverless itself has a cache or something calling the wrong file or whatever for creds so I uninstall serverless via sudo npm uninstall g serverless so that I can start from zero again I then do all of the above steps and more all over again and nothing has changed Same error message I do have Apex run set up but that should be using my AWS CLI config file so Im not sure if that is causing any problems But then again Ive no clue of anything deep on this subject and I cant find any ability to remove Apex itself in their docs In the package I am trying to deploy I do not have a profileXXX set in the serverless yml file because Ive read if you do not then it just defaults to the [default] profile you have set in the aws creds file on your computer Just to check I go into the serverless yml file and set the profile default and the error I now get when I run npm run deploy is Profile default does not exist How is that possible when I have the default profile set in my creds file So I remember that previously I ran the serverless config creditionals command and added the profile name of serverlessagent to it yet didnt save in the aws creds file as I mentioned above so I add that profile name to the serverless yml file just to see if this works and same error of Profile default does not exist So back to the error message The Role is an account not even related to the IAM user Im using in my aws creds Without knowing a lot about this its as if the config in serverless via ssh isnt correct or something Is it using old creds I had set up in Apex run Why is the aws creds file not updated with the profile when I manually set it in serverless config command I am using the same user account but with new key and secret that I used a few weeks ago when I correctly deployed and my Lambda and API was set up for me on AWS Boy do I miss those time and wish I didnt mess up my existing Lambda functions without setting version number prior forcing me to start all over I am so confused Any help would be greatly appreciated "
