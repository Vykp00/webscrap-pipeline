and multi region deployments In scope of a single service deploy different components to different regions also consider use case of deploying same component to multiple regions at once Fast development flow Ensure fast integration with a cloud but do not close the door for _offline emulation_ while it is being promoted as an antipattern users should be able to achieve that if they want to Any provider deployments Provide a mean to easily switch given _component_ to be deployed to other provider Programmatical API Allow to construct components programmatically IaC Ensure solid

potential solution was discussed by ac360 mnapoli fredericbarthelet medikoo and pgrzesik_ _Shares same goal as [`serverlesslift`] httpsgithub comgetliftlift plugin but with intention to evolve a current implementation of a Serverless Framework CLI into a solution which delivers firstclass multiproviders support so it does not happen via plugin or injected external CLI implementation _ General design and configuration structure New `providers` top level property in which target cloud vendors with eventual extra configuration should be listed e g ```yaml providers aws type aws additional config netlify type netlify additional config googleCloud type googlecloud additional config ``` New `tobenamed` top level property in which cloud components should be listed Current property name candidates `constructs` or `components` let us settle on `components` for now Components could be high level and low level High level component may construct needed low level components internally so they are not mentioned in configuration explicitly or user may configure low level components to be used by high level components ```yaml components Low level component someFunction type function provider aws additional config High level component staticWebsite type staticwebsite provider netlify additional config ``` Each listed provider indicates distinct deployment group For given provider type e g `aws` multiple providers can be configured That way multiple Cloudformation stacks could be configured or CloudFormation deployment could be accompanied with one made directly through AWS SDK Components may rely on outputs coming from other components Such cross dependencies influence the providerscomponents deployment order Atomic deployment depending on provider configuration is made either on provider or component level State management depending on provider configuration is handled either externally e g CloudFormation case or internally direct AWSSDK case Each provider type and component type can be constructed programmatically IaC way Abstract classes ideally should be published as separate paackage e g `serverlesscore` `serverlessbase` or similiar This package should be used as a base when creating specific Providers or Components Each provider and component may expose commands which can be triggered programmatically or via CLI to operate directly and just against given provider or component Provider specific command `sls providercommandname providername [ options]` e g we can deploy just specific provider via `sls providerdeploy netlify` Component specific command `sls componentcommandname componentname [ options]` e g current `sls invoke f functionname` could be represented via `sls componentinvoke functionname` Aside of that Framework will provide global CLI commands as `deploy` `remove` `info` `package` `print` and others TBD which will be processed against all configured providers Community extensionsplugins system Community may introduce their own providercomponent implementations by either 1 extending existing providerscomponents or by 2 creating new ones by extending documented abstractions we will provide Commands processing is backed by evented lifycycle engine through which community may hack into process and update existing behaviors in more general manner Integration with current Framework services CLI will support two service configuration modes exclusively either one we use currently with `provider` top level property setup or one with `providers` but with possibility to integrate existing service configuration into multi providers `providers` service by configuring it as one of the providers ```yaml providers oldService type legacy Current properties of serverless yml aside of some core ones provider name aws runtime nodejs14 x functions fucntionA handler index js ``` Such legacy provider type cannot be accompanied with components New provider component constructs may access deployment outputs of old provider and may pass their outputs to it this will also indicate the order whether legacy deployment is made before new providers after or maybe in parallel Legacy provider will support all old Framework commands they will have to be run against it specifically So e g current `sls invoke options` after integration could be achieved via `sls providerinvoke oldService options` Theoretically multiple legacy providers could be configured but it has to be ensured that our internals allow for multiple `Serverless` instances in same process and success with plugins may vary CLI process integration Handling of a new provider and components constructs will happen with a brand new deployment engine but most of the preliminary steps that happen in a CLI process like CLI input validation service configuration resolution will stay common to old Framework deployements and new multiprovider deployments To integrate new providers component constructs handling we will need to update our processing flow so when it detects Multi Providers configuration it runs Multi Providers engine Pre Multi Providers introduction CLI process flow Processing flow as of v3 with no Multi Providers

discussion Like in your case we are also following a multiaccount strategy and using serverless for holding our logic and define the required infrastructure Matter of fact is that weve just released a small product to production The main account being completely defined with serverless but weve left the management of the child account to a separate process This secondary account is purely infrastructure no lambdas so its kind of ok to manage it manually as an independent CFN stack We do have to create IAM roles and policies in this secondary account and add the lambda principals of the main account as trusted entities Ideally I would love to be able to have a breakdown of several services with their interdependencies being able to be defined and more importantly deployed in a consistent manner across environments via serverless There are a number of already ongoing feature requests that Id say could help greatly towards this goal 1 If you have a question and not a bugfeature request please ask it at h ttpforum serverless com 2 Please check if an issue already exists so there are no duplicates 3 Check out and follow our Guidelines httpsgithub comserverlessserverlessblobmasterCONTRIBUTING md 4 Fill out the whole template so we have a good overview on the issue 5 Do not remove any section of the template If something is not applicable leave it empty but leave it in the Issue 6 Please follow the template otherwise we will have to ask you to update it This is a Feature Proposal Description There are frequently people having trouble to find out the final resource names or identifiers that are used in the CF template because they need them for their custom resources e g Ref or GetAtt In the Serverless framework the generation of these identifiers is deterministic and they are already known at the very beginning of the lifecycles thus they are known at variable resolution time A new ` cfname ` variable resolution class can effectively solve the problems reduce complexity for the users and finally reduce the number of incoming issues It could work like this Reference Description ` cfname functionmyFunc ` Resolves to the logical id of myFunc ` cfname functionmyFuncversion ` Resolves to the logical id of the version resource of myFunc ` cfname functionmyFunceventxxx ` Resolves to the logical id of the automatically created event resource for event xxx of myFunc ` cfname apigdeployment ` Resolves to the name of the AWSApiGatewayDeployment resource ` cfname apigapiroot ` Resolves to the name of the AWSApiGatewayRestApi root resource These are only samples As soon as a name resolver is implemented the available entities that can be resolved can be added easily It would make sense to even offer resolution for non randomized resources because that will abstract the names away from the resources section and will not break if SLS changes them The variables then can be easily used anywhere in the serverless yml ``` Resources MyResourceThatNeedsARefToAFunction Type AWSSomething Properties Function Ref cfname functionmyFunc ``` Additional Data Serverless Framework Version you are using Operating System Stack Trace Provider Error messages Summary serverless framework is currently wedded to a few concepts which ma ke it very cumbersome to share javascript code and compiler compilation contexts between many node microservice stacks Specifically the fact that serverless does not allow specifying a path to the serverless config file pushes every set of cloudformation stacks deployed by serverless toward needing to be a separate npm package This requirement is essentially enforced by the framework due to the framework not exposing any mechanisms for supplying a path to the serverless config file to use for a given serverless invocation Problems Forcing developers toward describing every stack as an npm package adds a lot of overhead to the development process particularly when its desirable to share code between stacks What overhead is added by the need to describe each serverless stack as an npm package How much of this overhead is incidental complexity vs actually useful modularization I argue that for many projectscontexts this requirement adds a large amount of incidental complexity with net negative benefit rather than encouraging useful patterns every serverless deployable stack needs to setup and define its tooling environment Modern tooling requirements for javascript codebases are extensive compilerstranspilers test runners linters ide integrations Reuse of these processes between related projects is enormously beneficial It seems to be true that in general the fewer the number of packages for which you have to setup this tooling when working on related code the better the development experience you can arrange for your team every serverless deployable stack needs to describe full set of dependencies devDependencies and needs to separately install those dependencies in order for the serverless commands to be runnable Fullencapsulation of development environment rather than requiring the installation of tools globally into package json is very nice so if you wish to package all the required development dependencies then every stack deployment context ends up needing to install its own copy of the serverless framework If you are a using compilerlinter every stack is also going to need its own copy of the compiler and linter and configuration of those Every stack deployment context is going to need to manage versions of these things is going to have to install these things when setting up the development context for each stack and when running automated tests for each stack its very difficult to share code between stacks Simple solutions for sharing code between stacks that rely on nodes module resolution algorithm to organize shared dependencies will not work Furthermore normal techniques for easing development of related sets of npm packages will not work well with serverless because serverless does not handle packaging of symlinked node dependencies in a good way tools like `npm link`lernayarnworkspaces which aim to ease development of related sets of npm packages also do not work well with serverless If lerna symlinks relatedmodulea into servicebnode_modules then when serverless is packaging serviceb all of relatedmoduleanode_modules will be packaged into serviceb including all the dev dependencies for relatedmodulea not to mention source artificats the set of things normally excluded by npmignore etc This will generally make the package too large to deploy when packages have a lot of devDependencies This fact basically breaks the ability to use lerna to ease the development process of relatedmodulea in the context of testingdeployingpackaging serviceb even if we could use lerna the whole lerna concept is something of a large hack and for many projects introduces a large amount of complexity that may not actually be needed Goals For my purposes my goals are easily share code generated from a single compilation and testing context between serverless deployed stacks manage devDependencies and tooling configuration for as much of the codebase as possible in a single place shared code should be in the same compilation context for ensuring smoothest path to maximum benefit from compiler and ide tooling support easily creating new variations of a stack for use in automated testing or to deal with other kinds of strange businessdevelopment requirements ideally by just copyingmodifying a serverless yml file get the best experience from ides The pattern I have fallen on is to structure our repository like this ``` serverless_plugins custom plugins should be shareable between stacks package json scripts to start compiler run tests etc jest json jest debug json tsconfig json tslint json wallaby js src typescript code lib compiled javascript servicessome_serviceserverless yml servicessome_servicenode_modules node_modules servicessome_servicepackage json package json needed to expose devDependencies to serverless packaging process servicessome_servicelib lib servicessome_service serverless_plugins serverless_plugins ``` The basic idea of above pattern is to use symlinks to trick serverless so that running `serverless` command from any services directory behaves as if you had copied the serverless yml file into the project root directory and ran serverless from there Solution I really think a behavior like this should just be supported by default without having to use symlinks to hack a serverless yml file into the execution context of another folder I would like an option to allow providing a path to a yml file to use for serverless config This should interpret the config file as if the config file was located in the cwd paths defined in config files should be specified relative to the cwd everything should be executed just as if you had moved the configuration file to serverless yml prior to execution Alternative If adding the requested feature and exposing to users the ability to control which config file to use from the command line is not deemed desirable would a pull request that modified the Service class and Serverless constructor to allow easier implementation via a custom subclass of the Serverless class be accepted Right now I am monkey patching the serverless framework to allow using alternative config files in my automated testing environments Its not pretty and involved by necessity some copypasting but essentially required changing Service load method to consider options passed to Service constructor A little bit of changes to the framework could greatly ease this customization ``` PATCHED attempt to get serviceFilenames from `that` rather than only supporting hardcoded paths List of supported service filename variants The order defines the precedence const serviceFilenames that serviceFilenames null that serviceFilenames [serverless yaml serverless yml serverless json] ``` And then hacking the Serverless constructor to use my patched Service subclass and pass in custom path to serverless config file ``` export class JestServerlessConfig extends Serverless constructor serverlessContext JestServerlessContext configure servicePath super set servicePath to the directory in which you want serverless command to execute abs path servicePath serverlessContext executionPath interactive false HACK recreate the service this time with patched behavior this service new JestServerlessServicePatch this serviceFilenames [serverlessContext relativeServerlessConfigPath] HACK Variables class picks off this serverless service instance inside constructor and saves it make sure to update that reference to point at patched object this variables service this service this _jestServerlessContext serverlessContext ``` I also have to monkey patch serverlesslibutilsgetServerlessConfigFile Other Alternative Its possible I could add webpack to my build process and generate a bundle including all required node_modules for each services directory This could be a good alternative but webpack is complicated and it would be much slower It also would not really work all that well many varieties of common testing tools The need to do this ultimately results from a small addressable limitation of the serverless framework which I think would be better to handle with what seems a small augmentation to the framework With the new packagedeploy semantics the builds and deployments can be distrib uted on different servers The created artifacts can then be deployed to AWS using the CF template created in the build step Normally you construct your services so that some properties are set by variables defined in the serverless yml that are set depending on the service target e g stage or region A prominent example for that is the setting of Lambda environment variables Imagine you have the following service definition ``` service stashimibotdash provider name aws runtime nodejs6 10 stage dev region useast1 environment MY_VAR selfcustom selfcustom stage myVar custom stage optstage selfprovider stage dev myVar My3rdPartyAuthIdForDev prod myVar My3rdPartyAuthIdForProd ``` The problem with the package command is now that the variables are already substituted there and the CF template that is transferred to the deploy stage already contains the resolved variables As a consequence it is not possible to deploy a builtpackaged service to different stages i e the stage used to build also has to be used to deploy A workaround is to build all stagesregions independently on the build server create artifacts for each stage and deploy the corresponding artifact on the deployment server A proper solution would be that the build phase creates an artifact that is independent from the environment that the artifact is deployed to Proposal The build phase should keep the literal variable references in the artifacts CF template and the deploy phase should do the variable substitution depending on the stageregion selected at the time of deployment This would mean that only the variable subsitution functionality has to be moved Of course only variables that are usedplaced in the generated CF template should be deferred So maybe the `generateXXXTemplate ` function that is run in the build phase would be the target for a viable implementation then only the right variables would be affected On the deploy phase the substitution has to be made as soon as the CF template from the artifact is loaded to have the real values available for all plugins running in the deployment context Care has to be taken for plugins that might use the variable information during the build phase imo that is wrong anyway Essentially they are all targeted at being able better integration and easier management of the underlying CFN infrastructure There might be a case for a plugin that could wrap some of this requirements together However my knowledge of the internals of serverless is limited to envisage what could potentially be the path of least resistance Any potential hacks from other users or guiding input from serverless folks would be most welcome"
