not need a public access as the content is served from CloudFront It seems that CloudFormation does not have the permission to generate the required S3 policy Due to that I receive the following error Could it be related to the following What is the issue Amazon S3 Buckets have a property called `ObjectOwnersh ip` It has 3 possible settings `BucketOwnerEnforced` access to all objects in the bucket is controlled via the buckets Bucket Policy Access Control Lists ACLs are disallowed both on a perobject as well as bucketwide level `ObjectWriter` ACLs are allowed object writers decide the ACL for each object `BucketOwnerPreferred` ACLs are allowed object writers can decide each objects ACL but the default is to honor the Bucket Policy Before April 2023 the default was to create new buckets with `ObjectOwnership ObjectWriter` which means it is possible to configure ACLs on the buckets and on objects by default In April 2023 S3 has changed the default to `ObjectOwnership BucketOwnerEnforced` which means it is no longer possible to configure ACLs on the buckets and on objects by default Since this change affects only the defaults for new buckets this change has no effect on existing S3 Buckets Announcement [Amazon S3 will automatically enable S3 Block Public Access and disable access control lists for all new buckets starting in April 2023] httpsaws amazon comaboutawswhatsnew202212amazons3automaticallyenableblockpublicaccessdisableaccesscontrollistsbucketsapril2023 What is the impact Depending on your CDK version and feature flags CDK may try to configure buckets with an ACL relying on the default `ObjectOwnership ObjectWriter` for this to be allowed After April 2023 buckets with ACLs will fail to deploy with the following error ```text Bucket cannot have ACLs set with ObjectOwnerships BucketOwnerEnforced setting ``` What code is affected by this change If you meet any of the following criteria then you are not affected and can stop reading You are using `awscdklib 2 60 0` the feature flag `awscdkawss3serverAccessLogsUseBucketPolicy true` is set and you are not using CloudFront logging OR You are using `awscdklib 2 77 0` Otherwise keep on reading to find out what patterns may lead a bucket to fail creation You could be affected if you use `awscdklib aws_s3 Bucket` directly or if you use a 3rd party construct library that creates S3 Buckets There are a couple of cases how a Bucket created by CDK may end up with an ACL configured on it We will go over them here Explicit bucket ACL If you explicitly set the ACL to one of `PUBLIC_READ` `AWS_EXEC_READ` `PUBLIC_READ_WRITE` `AUTHENTICATED_READ` or `LOG_DELIVERY_WRITE` Example ```ts new s3 Bucket this Bucket accessControl s3 BucketAccessControl PUBLIC_READ ``` Using a serverAccessLogsBucket If you set one bucket as the `serverAccessLogsBucket` of another CDK automatically configures it with permissions for writing logs Example ```ts const serverAccessLogsBucket new s3 Bucket this AccessLogsBucket const sourceBucket new s3 Bucket this Bucket serverAccessLogsBucket ``` If you are on a version ` 2 60 0` and have the feature flag `awscdkawss3serverAccessLogsUseBucketPolicy true` configured CDK will use a Bucket Policy for log writing permissions and you are not affected Otherwise it will use ACLs and you are affected Using an S3 Bucket for CloudFront logs When you create a CloudFront Distribution with `enableLogging true` the CDK will automatically create a logging bucket for you that uses ACLs ```ts new cloudfront Distribution this Distribution enableLogging true ``` If you are providing your own `logBucket` you will fall into case 1 where you are explicitly configuring the bucket to use the log delivery ACL How do I resolve this If you upgrade `awscdklib` to `2 77 0` we will automatically set `ObjectOwnership` for you if you configure an ACL Only if you are not able to upgrade `awscdklib` quickly enough see the instructions below for workarounds Explicit ACL configuration If you are explicitly setting the Bucket ACL then you need to now also explicitly set the ObjectOwnership to `OBJECT_WRITER` ```ts new s3 Bucket this Bucket accessControl s3 BucketAccessControl PUBLIC_READ objectOwnership s3 ObjectOwnership OBJECT_WRITER ``` Using a serverAccessLogsBucket If configuring server access logs and you are on `awscdklib` `2 60 0 2 77 0` then set the `awscdkawss3serverAccessLogsUseBucketPolicy` feature flag to true This can be done either globally in the `cdk json` file or on a per construct basis by using `setContext` ```ts class MyConstruct extends Construct constructor scope Construct id string super scope id this node setContext awscdkawss3serverAccessLogsUseBucketPolicy true const serverAccessLogsBucket new s3 Bucket this AccessLogsBucket const sourceBucket new s3 Bucket this Bucket serverAccessLogsBucket ``` If using CDK v1 or `awscdklib` `2 60 0` then you have to configure ObjectOwnership directly ```ts const serverAccessLogsBucket new s3 Bucket this AccessLogsBucket objectOwnership s3 ObjectOwnership OBJECT_WRITER const sourceBucket new s3 Bucket this Bucket serverAccessLogsBucket ``` Using an S3 Bucket for CloudFront logs [CloudFront logging still requires ACLs] httpsdocs aws amazon comAmazonCloudFrontlatestDeveloperGuideAccessLogs htmlaccesslogschoosings3bucket If you are providing your own logging bucket to CloudFront then you need to make sure to set the `ObjectOwnership` property ```ts new cloudfront Distribution this Distribution logBucket new s3 Bucket this Bucket objectOwnership s3 ObjectOwnership OBJECT_WRITER ``` If you are using `enableLogging true` to have a bucket automatically created you should upgrade to `2 77 0` to set the `ObjectOwnership` option correctly or use escape hatches to force the option to `ObjectOwnership` serverless yml"},
